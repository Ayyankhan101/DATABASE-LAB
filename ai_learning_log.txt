AI INTERACTION #1
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Date: January 29, 2026
AI Tool: Claude / ChatGPT
TASK
----
I needed help with creating analytical SQL queries for my books_read database table. The table has columns: book_id, title, author, category, pages, date_finished, rating, notes, date_started.
PROMPT USED
-----------
"I need to write 5 analytical queries for my database assignment. The requirements are:
1. Filtering with WHERE clause
2. Aggregation with GROUP BY
3. Sorting with ORDER BY
4. Date manipulation function
5. Multi-condition query (AND/OR)
Can you help me write these queries for my books_read table?"
AI RESPONSE QUALITY
-------------------
Rating: (5/5 stars) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Helpful Because:
- Created all 5 required query types correctly
- Used appropriate PostgreSQL syntax
- Included clear explanations for each query
- Adapted to my actual table schema when I provided it
- Provided sample output format as requested
Not Perfect Because:
- Initially assumed column names that didn't exist in my schema
- Had to adjust queries after learning actual table structure
KEY LEARNINGS
-------------
1. Different SQL databases have different functions (DATEDIFF vs date arithmetic)
2. Always check table schema before writing queries
3. PostgreSQL uses (date1 - date2) for date differences, not DATEDIFF()
4. The RANDOM() function can be used to generate random dates
5. Proper formatting of analytical queries with explanations
Institue of Management Sciences Instructor Muhammad Usama Afridi
HOW I VERIFIED
--------------
1. Checked my table schema with \d books_read command
2. Confirmed existence of date_started and date_finished columns
3. Tested queries in PostgreSQL - all worked correctly
4. Verified each query met the specific requirements
5. Saved queries to analytical_queries.txt file
WHAT I MODIFIED
---------------
Created a comprehensive analytical_queries.txt file with all 5 queries
Added proper formatting with headers, SQL code, and explanations
Will use these queries for my database assignment submission
FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS
------------------
- Asked: "How can I add random dates to empty date columns?"
- Learned: Use ALTER TABLE and UPDATE with RANDOM() function
- Decision: Not needed since my table already had date columns

AI INTERACTION #2
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Date: January 29, 2026
AI Tool: Claude / ChatGPT
TASK
----
I needed help with adding random date values to my date_started column in the books_read table. I was getting syntax errors with my PostgreSQL commands.
PROMPT USED
-----------
"I'm trying to add random dates to my date_started column in PostgreSQL. My command is failing with syntax errors. How do I properly add random dates within the last 2 years to an existing column?"
AI RESPONSE QUALITY
-------------------
Rating: (4/5 stars) ⭐⭐⭐⭐
Helpful Because:
- Corrected my PostgreSQL syntax for random date generation
- Explained the proper way to use RANDOM() function with date arithmetic
- Showed how to use the ::INTEGER casting in PostgreSQL
- Provided alternative approaches for date manipulation
Not Perfect Because:
- Initially provided MySQL syntax instead of PostgreSQL
- Had to correct the response after I pointed out the error
KEY LEARNINGS
-------------
1. PostgreSQL uses different syntax than MySQL for date functions
2. The ::INTEGER casting operator in PostgreSQL
3. How to use RANDOM() function with date arithmetic
4. Proper syntax for date subtraction in PostgreSQL
5. Importance of checking database-specific syntax
Institue of Management Sciences Instructor Muhammad Usama Afridi
HOW I VERIFIED
--------------
1. Ran the corrected ALTER TABLE command - successful
2. Ran the UPDATE command with proper syntax - successful
3. Verified dates were added with SELECT query
4. Confirmed the random distribution looked appropriate
WHAT I MODIFIED
---------------
Used the corrected syntax: UPDATE books_read SET date_started = CURRENT_DATE - (RANDOM() * 730)::INTEGER;
Applied this to populate my date_started column with random dates
FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS
------------------
- Asked: "How can I ensure dates_started are before date_finished?"
- Learned: Use CASE statements or additional conditions
- Decision: Will keep current approach for simplicity

TASK
----
I needed help checking my database schema to understand the exact column names for my queries. I was getting errors because I assumed wrong column names.
PROMPT USED
-----------
"How can I check the schema of my PostgreSQL table to see all column names and types? I'm getting errors because I'm using wrong column names in my queries."
AI RESPONSE QUALITY
-------------------
Rating: (5/5 stars) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Helpful Because:
- Provided the exact command to check table schema (\d table_name)
- Showed how to list all databases with psql -l
- Explained how to connect to the correct database
- Demonstrated the complete workflow for schema inspection
- Helped me avoid further errors by knowing exact column names
Not Perfect Because:
- None - response was accurate and helpful
KEY LEARNINGS
-------------
1. Use \d table_name to see table schema in PostgreSQL
2. Use psql -l to list all databases
3. Always verify column names before writing queries
4. Understanding table structure prevents syntax errors
5. Schema inspection is a crucial debugging step
Institue of Management Sciences Instructor Muhammad Usama Afridi
HOW I VERIFIED
--------------
1. Ran psql -l to see all databases - found lab1_db
2. Ran psql -d lab1_db -c "\d books_read" - got full schema
3. Confirmed exact column names: book_id, title, author, etc.
4. Updated my queries with correct column names
5. All queries now work without errors
WHAT I MODIFIED
---------------
Adjusted all my analytical queries to use the exact column names from my schema
Will always check schema first before writing queries in the future
FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS
------------------
- Asked: "How can I see all tables in my database?"
- Learned: Use \dt command in PostgreSQL
- Decision: Will explore other tables in my database later
